# TechTalk
* Techtalk is an app targeted to General Assembly students and alumni that allows them to interact after graduation and share their knowledge and updates about their careers through the Myfeed feature.
* As a recent graduate, keeping up with the job search might be difficult. To assist them, our team designed a job page that displays tech and software positions, as well as a to-do list to help them organize their job search and thoughts.
